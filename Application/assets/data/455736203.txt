[02:20:38.957] xiatiandefeng666: especially sona, a support only
[02:20:58.017] VizeReZ: it gets sona to lane to stack support item faster so they can get farm sooner. Doesnt need another summoner, so just keep making map moves with TP for pressure.

[02:28:32.940] xiatiandefeng666: tear is bad because, 2 reason. 1) late game build , 2)damage is needed in fight . So, when you fight in the middle of the game, u only have mana but no damage
[02:29:05.196] CallMeGaizen: origen vs vitality?

[03:43:11.108] FlurryStrix: @creamhead3 which lane u like
[03:43:24.422] drySugar: unless something is stupidly op, you should just focus on 2 or 3 champions which fit your playstyle no matter if tzeyre top tier or not
[03:43:24.772] creamhead3: i like any lane
[03:43:25.033] MikamiShinji: Just play assassin champs

[04:36:44.026] spacezoro: @cantwololo You mean pepega?
[04:36:59.339] TheDuckAbuser: @machomen18 no one wants to watch you, i bet youre one of those who writes his stream in post game lobbies
[04:36:59.651] t2t4: @theduckabuser fair point, alot of dota heros rely in game knowledge and gamesense over raw mechanics
[04:37:25.600] fudleh: plat is decent. its not dimond or masters or chalenger or lec
[04:37:31.543] spacezoro: @machomen18 Just not a good place to plug stream my man

[04:38:07.227] SiouXerino: you cant compare a plat 2 to something like top 60 smite though
[04:38:12.358] TheDuckAbuser: @t2t4 i liked the game alot, just decided league felt better
[04:38:20.245] cantwololo: @spacezoro Yes.

[04:38:51.328] exiledd: @StrawHatGod becuase its annoying to see someone post their garbage zero effort stream of bad gameplay in this chat while you're watching something actually interesting
[04:38:55.809] spacezoro: @fudleh Doesnt make it any less annoying
[04:39:13.558] t2t4: @siouxerino sure, but ive given all of them a shot Nd I just prefer smite over league,
[04:39:14.869] StrawHatGod: @exiledd How do you know it’s garbage when you haven’t seen it?
[04:39:20.578] fudleh: shouldnt plug in someone elses stream though
