[01:16:52.522] DPTDave: @Nightblue3 why does the death recap look ugly now ?
[01:16:54.525] melissa4963: just make them far less tanky and give them dmg reduction abilities that they rely on
[01:16:56.704] XiuzSu: I guess, but they have cc/taunts
[01:16:59.880] sagia5: why do you go lethality in 4 tanks xD

[01:17:08.904] InfiniteKore: @Nightblue3 tanks need to draw aggro though. They'd need way more CC to be able to draw aggro without just being ignored outright
[01:17:10.177] chronowarrior: the only problem with that is you couldnt pplay a tank into a solo lane with anything that has damage because you would feed

[01:19:08.911] Codikin: if tanks did no damage and the enemy team has no tanks, just full damage, theyd delete the tanky teams carries and just ignore the tanks and end the game. thats way too one sided. tanks need to do damage.
[01:19:09.419] pappasmurf88: depends on the supp tho... u forfit a lot by going dmg support, so like brand can do some sort of 1v1 and thats fine imo
