[05:45:16.223] Paxwelll: @DarkSin3 well did it have a dick or vag
[05:45:18.229] KAEGANme23: THIS IS SPAAAAAAARTAAAA
[05:45:25.015] filfp: Myth pls watch when you die ingame some of the '76 genders' memes on youtube
[05:45:35.903] DarkSin3: Paxwelll i have no idea
[05:45:48.968] KAEGANme23: its a good fvid
[05:45:53.098] abyssal_panda_: I don't understand why it's so difficult for these sorts of people to understand SEX =/= GENDER
[05:46:04.984] PlanetRez: but if the argument is that gender identity is something you feel, then what if the baby grows up and says they dont have a gender?
[05:46:21.947] abyssal_panda_: it doesn't seem like it
[05:46:37.214] KAEGANme23: because its wrong... dude
[05:46:45.397] abyssal_panda_: like that surely it's asking for sex not gender, like most forms
[05:46:47.525] KAEGANme23: it has nothing to do with reproduction
[05:46:48.123] IrenaBaby: I have to do invoices before I forget, i'll brb zadddeeee
[05:46:53.716] lakesisking: when is the next big update?
[05:46:54.071] filfp: What does shinbis ult
[05:47:05.926] abyssal_panda_: whereas everyone's saying it's gender and there's a billion of them
[05:47:08.018] filfp: I think there are only 2 genders
[05:47:09.699] PlanetRez: Most of the time I just ask for the sex that way Im less confused
[05:47:11.740] KAEGANme23: identifing as a fucking color is a mental disorder or people trying to be unique
[05:47:19.132] KAEGANme23: its not healthy
[05:47:27.429] KAEGANme23: just like people glorifying obesity
[05:47:29.422] KAEGANme23: its stupid
[05:47:31.843] abyssal_panda_: or fucking anti-boy or anti-girl
[05:47:37.354] DarkSin3: idgaf what people want to identify as, it really doesnt bother me. each to their own etc. but biologically you are either male/female
[05:47:41.657] filfp: Cause made penis and vagina these ate two so there are 2 genders imo
[05:47:48.498] abyssal_panda_: @darksin3 XXY
[05:47:52.773] abyssal_panda_: chromosomes
[05:48:01.227] hectorino375: are you thinking about mastering anyone else lately
[05:48:09.999] filfp: Cause god made*
[05:48:20.019] DarkSin3: is that a thing? knowledge me up
[05:48:27.216] izekio5: is it possible to be a support Shibi
[05:48:51.566] PlanetRez: I do think that it shouldnt be that you identify as ANYTHING, but I will say that I do think its perfectly okay to say I feel like a certain sex and not what I am. But thats just my two cents.
[05:48:56.863] abyssal_panda_: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome
[05:48:57.665] filfp: Is shinbi a gender?
[05:49:08.492] PlanetRez: I sexually identify as shinbi
[05:49:11.388] abyssal_panda_: first thing I found
[05:49:19.349] krisago: I just got master shinbi today
[05:49:28.942] Mistrusting: i also sexually identify as shinbi
[05:49:34.634] krisago: What do you think shinbi identifies as
[05:49:44.611] Mistrusting: @krisago wolfsexual
[05:49:49.679] filfp: Is mustard a gender?
[05:49:54.018] KAEGANme23: my main view on life is do whatever you want, as long as you dont step on other peoples rights go for it
[05:50:04.682] PlanetRez: Is mayonnaise a gender Kappa
[05:50:08.902] filfp: In this case is every single person a own gender
[05:50:09.495] KAEGANme23: but my rights also dont end where yours begin, nor do they end where you get offended
[05:50:40.337] KAEGANme23: if you dont like what i have to say, then stfu and dont bring it up, b/c i will fill you in on my opinion <3
[05:50:45.911] DarkSin3: interesting
[05:50:48.368] abyssal_panda_: well, sex identity is chromosomes and hormones whereas gender identity is more how you feel so to speak
[05:51:14.763] PlanetRez: In all honesty both sides now a days are just telling the other how to believe. It really doesnt matter
[05:51:16.721] hectorino375: anyone you wanna master @myth
[05:51:22.598] krisago: Do you think shinbi is a furry on the side
[05:51:24.996] filfp: Is adipositas a gender
[05:51:53.828] KAEGANme23: that creamy white goodness
[05:52:00.515] KAEGANme23: that stinks slightly of eggs
[05:52:03.066] KAEGANme23: lol
[05:52:48.881] filfp: Dude you triggered me Kappa Kappa
[05:52:52.489] PlanetRez: I think you mean white people are afraid to talk about @ImTheMyth Kappa
[05:53:02.274] Oishi_Biru: u see boy

[05:53:53.468] PlanetRez: @ImTheMyth thats why I put the Kappa
[05:53:55.078] Djohnson2897: does shinbi utl stacks wen she using all of her abilities?
[05:54:06.949] nick_steven09: do a nanoplasm,clear heart troll shinbi build
[05:54:23.596] abyssal_panda_: @imthemyth most are since they'll get shit from all sides
[05:54:37.033] PlanetRez: LOL, no vody but us will know that Im being sarcastic
[05:54:39.432] PlanetRez: RIP my life
[05:54:46.208] hectorino375: why do you have so much health regen MYTH
[05:54:49.601] PlanetRez: "local streamer shuts down channel over race issues"
[05:54:51.666] krisago: You should try a tankier shinbi build, it works pretty well
[05:54:55.107] KAEGANme23: rip so close
[05:55:28.693] Ezghoul: i see the partical blindness hasnt changed in the game haha

[05:56:01.715] abyssal_panda_: @imthemyth is there any way to change that?
[05:56:18.342] hectorino375: does your right click give you more health regen
[05:56:25.131] PlanetRez: like as a white male all Ive ever been met with when I try to have a discussion about it is that "Im white and wouldn't understand"
[05:56:28.985] Ezghoul: so many effects going on you can still lose focus easily
[05:56:36.915] PlanetRez: its just one of those things where Im just like well tell me why
[05:57:02.140] rayshawn: I understand race but not gender
[05:57:28.129] rayshawn: Reason why people get mad
[05:57:47.167] PlanetRez: Thats the trick cap, I dont understand anything
[05:58:03.632] rayshawn: KIt-Kat
[05:58:11.673] PlanetRez: I just watch fox news or msnbc and agree with whatever they tell me Kappa
[05:58:48.109] PlanetRez: that feel when he help you get the kill
[05:58:49.112] rayshawn: AHHH I saw what u did there.

[06:01:40.530] PlanetRez: @ImTheMyth dont forget about the ones who just take a shower
[06:01:52.110] k0ok3r: ^
[06:02:04.026] k0ok3r: cause wiping alone is not going to get shit off
[06:02:12.757] k0ok3r: you know how many lines in your skin you have
[06:02:20.534] k0ok3r: wiping ain't gonna clean it
[06:02:28.400] PlanetRez: I hate the opposite, if I take a shower then poop I feel like my day is ruined
[06:02:36.458] Ezghoul: its called baby wipes.. they do wonders :P

[06:03:03.294] abyssal_panda_: @imthemyth just do what Europeans do
[06:03:13.272] abyssal_panda_: use a bidet or whatever it's called
[06:03:23.094] PlanetRez: @ImTheMyth and then theres the dirty cheesers who dont wipe at all
[06:03:30.115] PlanetRez: now that is the true scum of the earth
[06:03:37.671] PlanetRez: theyd watch mufasa die and not even care
[06:03:57.191] Ezghoul: lmao join the military, youll learn how much a baby wipe can do ^^
[06:04:03.009] xChiefPelican: Those are the same people that laugh when Bambi's mama dies
[06:04:21.746] nick_steven09: so sloppy
[06:04:27.941] PlanetRez: as somebody who hunts I didnt feel anything @Protagonistic_Mindset
[06:04:47.810] xChiefPelican: @PlanetRez So I take it that you don't wipe your ass then DansGame

[06:05:43.929] biggyswish: Add me
[06:05:50.714] biggyswish: Bobs Burers
[06:06:07.431] Redleader32: i too enjoy wet wipes so much more soothing than dry toilet paper
[06:06:22.074] killabob_: I prefer 1 ply anyways
[06:06:25.259] PlanetRez: I just put toilet paper under hot water tbh
[06:06:28.021] PlanetRez: works wonders
[06:07:10.315] Redleader32: wet wipes op my dude
[06:07:42.538] Redleader32: water toilet paper breaks up on ur ass
[06:07:45.755] PlanetRez: nah, my sink is right next to the toilet
[06:08:15.656] killabob_: The issue with wet wipes is that they won't degrade like tp, so I'm assuming you'd have to throw them away
[06:08:21.459] xChiefPelican: Nah if you only put a little water you're fine
[06:08:32.569] xChiefPelican: put too much and it gets all soggy and crumbly
[06:08:34.411] nick_steven09: papa sev killin your ass
[06:08:37.278] xChiefPelican: yah gotta do it just right~
[06:08:38.458] PlanetRez: see this is why I look up to this stream, we just had a deep conversation about toilet paper and ass wiping right after a discussion about gender and race
[06:08:40.644] PlanetRez: what a world
[06:09:12.442] k0ok3r: it breaks down
[06:09:18.773] PlanetRez: only rv toilet paper degrades
[06:09:20.805] Eyerox: baby wipes you throw away - they make wet wipes specifically for adults that do degrade like toilet paper
[06:09:33.360] Ezghoul: ^ yea they do
[06:10:05.808] Ciberbob_Zotax: hello there man
[06:10:06.870] abyssal_panda_: @imthemyth when I did field craft in cadets we used ration packs like my military uses and with that the closest thing to toilet paper we had were the small pack of tissues you got with the ration pack
[06:10:08.630] nick_steven09: dam sev
[06:10:27.940] nick_steven09: right
[06:10:30.651] PlanetRez: @ImTheMyth see this is why I look up to this stream, we just had a deep conversation about toilet paper and ass wiping right after a discussion about gender and race
