[04:57:47.128] Syvar1: @Nightblue3 Yo, about Steam uninstalling ARK... It's not uninstalled. There's a weird bug where sometimes after crashes Steam won't recognize the game as installed. That's what happened to you. Hitting install on Steam will force it to check for existing files and then download any missing ones. For you thought there are no missing files so it won't download anything. Honestly the process shouldn't take more than 10 minutes.

[05:02:39.405] Syvar1: @Nightblue3 Yo, about Steam uninstalling ARK... It's not uninstalled. There's a weird bug where sometimes after crashes Steam won't recognize the game as installed. That's what happened to you. Hitting install on Steam will force it to check for existing files and then download any missing ones. For you thought there are no missing files so it won't download anything. Honestly the process shouldn't take more than 10 minutes.

[05:47:46.271] versati1ebr: Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day. Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero. He is consistently ranked both by scholars[5] and the public[6] as among the greatest U.S. presidents.
